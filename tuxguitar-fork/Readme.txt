some changes that had not been merged into TG, pushed back into the latest version.

Files in plugins-1.5.2 require tuxguitar-lib.jar from core-1.5.2

Close TuxGuitar, copy over existing files.

Lilypond export and GPX import improvements.  Needs refactoring, and added to all file types.

Mostly, this tries to get the correct note spelling (reference Tonal Pitch Class doc from MuseScore)

I put a pretty bug bug in GP1 and GP2 files back in January, so update with the latest gtp plugin soonish.
