♪ Beautiful Love ♪

Beautiful love, you are all mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'till you came along
Thrilling, my soul with your song

Beautiful love, I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realize
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love, will my dreams come true

Searching for love, my dreams to realize
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love, will my dreams come true
