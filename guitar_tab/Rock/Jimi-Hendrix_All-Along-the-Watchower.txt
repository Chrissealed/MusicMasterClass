          Am                G                F           G   Am 
   There must be some kind of way out of here, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Said the joker to the thief. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   There's too much confusion; 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   I can't get no relief. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Business men, they drink my wine, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Plowmen dig my earth. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   None of them  along the line. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Know what any of it is worth. 

Am                G                F           G   Am 
   No reason to get excited, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   The thief, he kindly spoke. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   There are many here among us 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Who feel that life is but a joke, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   But you and I, we've been through that 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   And this is not our fate, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   So let us stop talking falsely nowâ€” 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   The hour is getting late. 

Am                G                F           G   Am 
   All along the watchtower 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   princes kept the view 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   while all the women came and went, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   barefoot servants too. 

Am                G                F           G   Am 
  Outside in the cold distance 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   a wildcat did growl. 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   Two riders were approaching 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   and the wind began to howl. 

Am                G                F           G   Am 
   All along the watchtower, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   All along the watchtower, 
Am                G                F           G   Am 
   All along the watchtower.
