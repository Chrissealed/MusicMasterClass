Intro- Bm G A Bm


Bm                               G
On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light

A                                     Bm
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight

Bm                                         G
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right

A                                Bm
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

Bm                                        G
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore

A                                             Bm
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores

Em                                           Bm
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go

Em                                   A
In fire and pain, and once again we know


          D         A
So now we fly ever free
       G
We're free before the thunderstorm

Bm                A            G
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on

Bm              Em      Bm             D
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight

Em                                 A
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls


[Chorus:]

           G                 Bm
So far away we wait for the day

        A                           Bm
For the light source so wasted and gone

            G                       Bm
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days

  A                                        Bm
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Bm
As the red day is dawning

G
And the lightning cracks the sky

A
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above

Bm
With resentment in their eyes

Bm
Running back from the mid-morning light

           G
There's a burning in my heart

        A
We're banished from a time in a fallen land

Bm
To a life beyond the stars

Em
In your darkest dreams see to believe

     Bm
Our destiny is time

    Em                             A
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

           D           A         G
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality

Bm            A            G
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone

Bm                 E           Bm             D
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind

Em                                 A
Day after day this misery must go on


[Chorus]


             Bm                           G
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands

             A                    Bm
We fought so hard now can we understand

               Bm                      G
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can

    A                Bm
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]
